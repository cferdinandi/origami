# Origami - A fluid mobile-first grid system. 
Origami is simple, barebones template for building grid-based, mobile-first websites.

Adapted from [Foldy960 by Dave Rupert](https://github.com/davatron5000/Foldy960), Origami includes:

* A 6-column, fluid grid.
* Offsets for more flexible layouts design.
* A special class to flip the order of your grids (for content choreography).
* A special class for image galleries.

## How It Works
Getting started with Origami is really easy. [View the online tutorial](http://cferdinandi.github.com/origami/) or dig through the `index.html` file.
